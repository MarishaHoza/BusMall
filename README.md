## BusMall Market Research Website
The purpose of this application is to gather market research for the new startup BusMall, a catalog to be provided in buses and public transport within the Puget Sound regional transit system.

Catalogs are expensive to print and distribute, so this application intends to gather market research about the most popular products, so BusMall can include only relevent adds in their catalogs.
